                According to Lattice's latest research, nearly 75% of US employees are either actively looking or are open to new opportunities in the next 6-12 months. Younger people value belonging more than compensation. Companies are desperately trying to find solutions to hire and keep their best talent. One investment that can improve all parts of talent management is incorporating mindfulness practices and principles into them.
                Mindfulness is being present non-judgmentally, with an open and inquiring mind.
                People who practice mindfulness will cultivate qualities like being more focused, creative, resilient, and empathetic, among other things. These advantages are so crucial to being productive and fulfilled at work.
